You’ll shape the experience strategy for a system of AI agents and their surrounding tooling. You’ll partner closely with founders and cross-functional leads to define design standards, lead large problem spaces, and set the tone for how design operates at Alby. As the second designer on a small-but-mighty team, this is a rare opportunity to help establish a design culture at a company building at the frontier of AI-powered commerce and beyond.</p> <h3><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Define UX strategy for a multi-agent AI system, leading the design of experiences that serve merchants, marketers, and shoppers.</li> <li>Lead end-to-end design across high-impact projects.

  "description" : "<div id=\"blog-article-content-1\"><div> <p>Growth is really part and parcel for us here at Designlab.</p> <p>When you’re a small, ambitious team aiming to transform an industry, growth is both an explicit aim, and a side effect of the work that you do. Growth is also nebulous and multifaceted.</p> <p>At Designlab, we push to grow the number of students we reach in order to help transform more careers; we push for curriculum growth in order to stay cutting edge; and we push for personal growth in order to engage and keep our talented team.</p> <p>Our challenge is not if there is space for growth, but rather, being deliberate about the growth opportunities we empower our team to pursue. Part of being deliberate is making sure that growth pathways are visible, and up until recently, we had no good way of doing this.</p> <p>So, out of the need to provide our team with inspiring and exciting growth trajectories, the idea of building out growth ladders was born. Being a team of UX/UI design educators, we knew the first thing we had to do was put the user, our employees, at the center.</p> <p>Read on to learn about how we created career paths for our employees through growth ladders and a <a href=\"https://designlab.com/ux-research-course/\">user-centered design</a> approach.</p> <h2>12 Questions to Predict Employee Performance</h2> <p>The decision to build growth ladders left us with a challenge.</p> <p>We know that growth is happening amongst our employees here at Designlab, and we believe that it’s important to our team to develop both <a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/what-companies-look-for-in-product-designers-ux-designers-hire/\">hard and soft skills</a>. What we sought to understand was just how much of a priority it is for employees, and, to find a transparent, engaging way to represent potential growth pathways to the team.</p> <p>There is a tremendous amount of new research available on maintaining high employee engagement, while still promoting growth and a healthy <a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/how-to-increase-work-life-balance-when-working-remotely/\">work-life balance</a>. But the Gallup Q12 statements are what heavily informed our thinking on growth ladders.</p> <p>Gallup's employee engagement work is based on more than 30 years of in-depth behavioral economic research involving more than 17 million employees. Through rigorous research, Gallup identified 12 core elements—<a href=\"https://q12.gallup.com/public/en-us/Features\">the Q12</a>—that link powerfully to key business outcomes.</p> <p>These 12 questions emerged as those that best predict employee and workgroup performance:</p> <ol role=\"list\"> <li> Do you know what is expected of you at work? </li> <li> Do you have the materials and equipment to do your work right? </li> <li> At work, do you have the opportunity to do what you do best every day? </li> <li> In the last seven days, have you received recognition or praise for doing good work? </li> <li> Does your supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about you as a person? </li> <li> Is there someone at work who encourages your development? </li> <li> At work, do your opinions seem to count? </li> <li> Does the mission/purpose of your company make you feel your job is important? </li> <li> Are your associates (fellow employees) committed to doing quality work? </li> <li> Do you have a best friend at work? </li> <li> In the last six months, has someone at work talked to you about your progress? </li> <li> In the last year, have you had opportunities to learn and grow? </li> </ol> <p>This research reinforced the importance of actively pursuing personal growth as a key pillar of our business. It also further reinforced that building growth ladders for the team would be worth our time and effort.</p> <p>At Designlab, we believe that every person needs to contribute positively towards creating a culture which values the behaviors outlined by the Q12 statements.</p> <h2>The Challenges of Creating Growth Ladders</h2> <p><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/how-to-get-most-from-designlab-short-course/\">Personal growth</a> is driven by the ambitions and interests of each individual. However, in order to be successful in its application within a business context, personal growth needs to also happen in combination with the needs of the company. This is a complex balancing act.</p> <p>There is immense value in empowering individuals to grow skills you don’t even know your company needs yet. But there is also value in getting the day-to-day work done. This is a complex balancing act.</p> <p>There’s also an undeniable link between personal growth and compensation. We’ve found that anything involving money has the potential to be both highly sensitive and highly emotive.</p> <p>We thought a lot about this complicated and nuanced balance of matching <a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/how-to-set-smart-goals-for-your-career-ux-design-growth/\">personal development goals</a> with company goals. In the end, we decided that our best path forward was to involve the team.</p> <h2>4 Things to Keep In Mind When Designing Growth Ladders</h2> <p>Each team member played a direct part in developing their growth ladders. </p> <p>Individuals were invited to either write and design their own goals, or, management would provide goals and they could comment and provide feedback throughout the process. </p> <p>Here were some of the things we noticed when designing growth ladders with our employees.</p> <h2>1. Not everyone wants to be a manager</h2> <p>One of the most common themes we saw was that not everyone wanted to be a manager—but everyone does want to grow upward! </p> <p>Thus, we decided to design two alternate tracks: a “management” track and a “specialist” track. The former naturally lends itself more to managing others, and eventually overseeing entire teams. The latter is concerned with a <a href=\"http://designlab.com/blog/important-ux-design-skills\">hyper-specialization of skills</a> and knowledge, so that they remain valuable assets to any given project/department.</p> <h2>2. Don’t forget about soft-skills</h2> <p>There are many things we do daily in our job that we forget to measure, or have a hard time tracking. These are things like: communication, time management, creativity, and adaptability. It was important for us to categorically include these kinds of skills where appropriate, and make sure they were improving commensurate with the growth of an employee. </p> <h2>3. Do your market research</h2> <p>We heavily research various city indices and average salaries when designing our growth ladders. We then pinpointed compensation in the growth ladder to be about a quartile above market average in order to remain competitive in our salaries.</p> <h2>4. Transparency is key</h2> <p>Like with everything else in our business, we tried to be as transparent as possible throughout the process of designing these growth ladders. This meant working closely with each team member on their ladder—as much or as little as they may have wanted.</p> <p>Several thorough discussions about scope, responsibility, language, and levels heavily informed our growth ladders. This was in an effort to make sure every individual was content with what they had set forth in their growth ladders, and knew what growth was expected of them.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>In the end, we built a growth ladder for each team member and role in the company. </p> <p>Each growth ladder is based on a matrix of responsibilities and the corresponding expectations for each responsibility by level of seniority. This sounds complicated, but really all it means is that we built a career path that each team member can use to develop their skills and hold themselves accountable to their goals. </p> <p>We also empower individuals to move into new roles as they become available if they align with their interests. This means that a team member does not have to look to only the growth ladder of their current role when building out their personal development plan. </p> <p>Growth ladders have allowed us to build personal development plans that are relevant and helpful for both the individual and the greater team. We expect to be maintaining and updating these ladders on a quarterly basis as the company grows.</p> <p><em>Illustration by Gina Medranda</em></p> <p>Learn more about user-centered design in our <a href=\"https://designlab.com/ux-academy/\">UX Academy</a>.</p> </div></div>",

And, after 3 long years of being apart (thank you, pandemic), we finally gathered together in September.</p> <h2>The Location: Cascais, Portugal</h2> <p>Past retreats have taken place in:</p> <ul> <li>Barcelona, Spain</li> <li>Salt Lake City, Utah</li> <li>Breckenridge, Colorado</li> <li>Woodstock, New York</li> </ul> <p>This time around, we chose Cascais, Portugal.</p> <figure> <figcaption>The beautiful Cascais harbor.</figcaption></figure> <p>The location-planning squad scoured many locations to find a place that would offer a great spot for us to work and socialize.</p> <p>A few key criteria for the location were:</p> <ul> <li>A place where all team members could travel to the destination in 15 hours or less</li> <li>Average travel costs were within a set budget</li> <li>The accommodations provided space for all team members to stay and work, and were close to local activities to allow us to connect less formally</li> </ul> <p>Cascais ticked all of the boxes for us, with its close proximity to the Lisbon airport, resort accommodations, and the beautiful surrounding scenery!</p> <h2>Logistics: The Planning Committee</h2> <p>Bringing 27 team members together for a week required an incredible amount of planning and coordination. We’re incredibly grateful to the 11 team members who took on this responsibility (in addition to their day-to-day workload!)</p> <p>The retreat committee assisted with the planning and implementation of:</p> <ul> <li>Location selection</li> <li>Booking rooms</li> <li>Coordinating with the venue</li> <li>Planning meals</li> <li>Transportation (including flights, shuttles, and rental cars)</li> <li>Daily “extra curricular” activities that gave team members a chance to sightsee and spend some more unstructured time together</li> </ul> <h2>The Schedule</h2> <p>While we work and collaborate efficiently in our remote work environment, we wanted to make the most of our in-person time together. This meant finding a balance between workshops, co-working sessions, and team building activities.</p> <h3>Mornings</h3> <p>For this retreat, we spent the mornings in sessions that focused on company objectives and key results (OKRs, brand updates, a conscious leadership workshop, and a collaborative session where we began the process of assessing and realigning our company values.</p> <figure></figure> <h3>Afternoons</h3> <p>In addition to a few larger group sessions, afternoons also included time to break off into smaller teams and co-work together, followed by a span of time where team members could opt to participate in a fun activity (or simply relax and be on their own).</p> <figure></figure> <h3>Optional Fun Time</h3> <p>Every afternoon, there were a selection of fun activities that we could choose to participate in, from shopping in Cascais Old Town to visiting the famous Boca do Inferno. </p> <figure> <figcaption>An evening walk to the famous Boca do Inferno</figcaption></figure> <h2>Retreat Highlights</h2> <p>It was incredible to spend time with each other in 3D, and there were a lot of laughs, new inside jokes, and deep insights that came out of our time together. </p> <p>Here are just a few of the comments shared by retreat attendees:</p> <figure></figure> <blockquote> <p>It was great to spend IRL time with our immediate teammates but also our colleagues that we may not meet with on a day to day basis. Having both structured and unstructured time to collaborate, hang out and learn more about each other was invaluable. I think it really enhanced our already-pretty-darn-good work culture and relationships. Can’t wait for the next one! - Matt Shaw, Head of Engineering</p> </blockquote> <figure></figure> <blockquote> <p>The best part about our retreat was realizing the strong bond we were able to build through our screens. It felt like we had met in person many times before and it was all thanks to the amazing communication we established across the board - Zeynep Ozkasim, CX Lead</p> </blockquote> <h2>Retrospective</h2> <p>We want to make the most out of our retreats, and ensure that our time together is meaningful and worthwhile. </p> <p>So after the retreat ended and we were all back to our respective lives (at home, or traveling onwards as digital nomads), each team member was asked to share their candid thoughts and reflections through a survey.</p> <p>This helped us to get a better feel about how each person experienced the retreat, and how various elements (like location, individual sessions, meals, and activities) might be improved for the next retreat. </p> <p>The retrospective helps us to stay grounded and identify what truly went as well as we had hoped, where there’s room for improvement. </p> <h2>Until We Meet Again…</h2> <p>We ended our time together with a lot of laughter and overall hilarity during a series of pizza parties (including delicious gluten free options!), games, and overall just enjoying each other’s company. </p> <p>The jury’s still out on when and where the next retreat will be, but until then, we continue our remote lifestyle with a deeper sense of community and friendships forged in our time together.</p> <p><em>To join us on our next retreat (fabulous location TBD) apply to be a member of our team! </em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://designlab.com/careers/\"><em>Check out our open roles here</em></a>.</p> </div></div>",

We work with marketing teams to deliver websites, presentations, PDFs, and illustrations. If you have agency or in-house experience designing marketing material for established brands–read on, my friend, read on. </div> <h2>About Lightboard</h2> <p>We are a no-nonsense design service that delivers quality craftsmanship to established brands like Autodesk, GitHub, and Microsoft, as well as innovative younger companies.</p> <p>We believe the traditional agency model is fundamentally broken. Our clients don't need a full-service creative agency—they've already developed their strategy and need high-quality design to bring it to life, quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>And that's what Lightboard does.</p> <div> <h2>About the Position</h2> <p>We are looking for a well-rounded and results-focused freelance designer anywhere in the United States.</p> <p>A successful candidate will have demonstrated solid experience with layout (presentations, PDFs) and digital design (web, social, ads).</p> <p>Illustration, animation, or experience with Webflow are all major pluses (but we don't expect someone to be great at all of those things).</p> <p>Attention to detail, dedication to the craft of design, and a great attitude are a must.</p> <p>Our customers are typically growth-stage tech companies. They have a marketing team but not a design team, and that's where we step in to help.</p> <p>We pull together the right team for the customer and whip their brand into shape. One project might be a complete brand refresh—from website to collateral—and another might be executing a set of spot illustrations. This is a position where you can quickly work with a lot of different clients, brands, and styles.</p> <p>Our engagements are led by our Creative Services Managers. We don't have any sales people making empty promises; our Creative Services Managers are experienced designers themselves, and they handle logistic, budget, and strategic issues so our designers can focus on design. You never have to engage directly with a customer through Lightboard, unless you want to be involved.</p> <p>We're respectful of the design process and work hard to create realistic and flexible budgets and timelines. We do not work weekends or after hours, and our customers are (mostly) fantastic people we love to work with.</p> <p>For examples of the quality of our work, take a look at our <a href=\"https://lightboard.com/portfolio\">portfolio</a> and our <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/lightboard\">Dribbble profile</a>.</p> <p>What you need:</p> <ul> <li>Excellent communication and time management skills.</li> <li>Expertise with professional design tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign). We also work with Sketch and Figma, but can show you the ropes if you haven't tried them yet.</li> <li>Experience with presentation design (PowerPoint and Keynote).</li> <li>Exquisite portfolio of branding, layout, and digital design for modern B2B companies.</li> <li>Enthusiastic attitude and client skills. Our customers aren't always right, and we sometimes need to (gently) show them the right path.</li> </ul> <p>Super-duper bonus points:</p> <ul> <li>Experience with light web development (Webflow, WordPress, and email templates).</li> <li>Extraordinary collection of funny cat GIFs.</li> <li>Engaged as a full-time freelancer. We do not work with moonlighting full-timers.</li> <li>Expertise in starting each item in a bulleted list with the same letter.</li> </ul> <p>How it works:</p> <ul> <li>10-30hrs per week, working remotely. You control your schedule. Pay range is between $35 - $65/hr, depending on experience and quality of design. We pay upon project completion, and process invoices within 14 days.</li> <li>You usually work with the same set of clients, with our creative services managers handling client communication and budgeting.</li> <li>We have art directors, illustrators, and developers available to help with more complex projects, and you'll often find yourself working with a team of designers on a project.</li> </ul> </div> <div>To apply, please send your resume, portfolio, and the worst time that Illustrator (or Photoshop or Sketch or MS Paint) has crashed on you. </div> <div> <a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"#\">Apply via Email</a><p><small>To apply, send an email to jobs@lightboard.com</small></p> </div> <div><p>Lightboard is an equal opportunity employer and we are committed to providing a work environment that is free from any form of discrimination.</p></div> </div>",
