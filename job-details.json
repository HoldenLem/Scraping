  "description" : "Who we are\n\nAt Help Scout, we’re on a mission to help businesses delight more customers. We’ve been on this journey since 2011, and today more than 12,000 companies use our platform to provide outstanding customer support. We’ve been fully remote from the beginning, and have a team of 140+ people all over the world.\n\nWe love crafting beautiful products and growing a business together, but we're also trying to do something bigger. We're building a company that brings out your best and leaves the world a better place — a company that seeks balance between profit and purpose. That's why we've been a Certified B Corporation since 2019 and have pledged 1% of our equity back to the community.\n\nHelp Scout’s success hinges on hiring talented, high-accountability people who want to be part of creating a culture where we all feel challenged and supported to do our best work. We hope that excites you to join us!\n\nCompany values\nHappy to Help\n\nHelp is our first name. We show up for others, not because we have to, but because we want to. We share knowledge and give freely by default, and operate with generosity and empathy for each other, our customers, and our community. After all, there is no I in team (or software).\n\nCraft over Convention\n\nAlthough it’s tempting to follow a well-worn path, we push ourselves to run beyond it — even when that sets us apart from our peers. We’re building a culture where it’s safe to be ambitious and hold each other to high standards. That’s why we obsess over the last 10%, because it shows up for our customers and the business in powerful ways.\n\nProgress not Perfection\n\nThe work of building a product, culture, and brand is never done – we ship our best effort, listen, iterate, then repeat. Seeking progress requires the vulnerability to be curious, humble, and hungry to learn. Great ideas can come from anywhere, so we share our work openly, welcome the perspective of others, and continuously search for what can be improved.\n\nOwn the Outcome\n\nOwnership is key to our collective success. We consider the impact on our team and our community before we act, and believe that trust and integrity are non-negotiable. To create a better future, our decisions are made with stakeholders today and ten years from now in mind.\n\nRead more about how we define, share, and live these values here.\n\nYour Impact\n\nAs a Frontend Engineer at Help Scout, you'll play a pivotal role in building for our 12,000+ customer-centric businesses worldwide.

Your expertise in JavaScript and modern frontend technologies will help us deliver exceptional UI/UX, ensuring customer service is proactive, personalized, and meaningful.\n\n\nTools We Use\n\nFrontend Technologies: React, Redux, Next.js, CSS, Jest, Cypress\n\nDesign Systems: Contribute to and utilize our component-based design system\n\nBackend Technologies (Nice to Have): PHP, REST APIs\n\nCollaboration Tools: Slack, Jira, GitHub, Docker\n\nAbout the Role\n\nYou’ll work closely with designers, product managers, and backend engineers in small, agile teams within an engineering group of about 50 people.\n\nYou’ll maintain high standards while contributing to Help Scout’s JavaScript and CSS best practices, leaving codebases better than you found them.\n\nYou’ll partner with Designers in implementing UI/UX designs from Figma and Storybook, always prioritizing the customer experience and ensuring every interaction is polished and intuitive.\n\nYou’ll improve performance, security, and usability to ensure a magical customer experience.\n\nYou’ll occasionally work with backend technologies, especially REST APIs, to power frontend features (PHP and NextJS are pluses.)\n\nYou’ll embrace remote work, participating in two-week iterations and communicating mostly via Slack. Autonomy and trust are key—we believe in getting work done where and when you are most productive.\n\nAbout You\n\nYou’re an exceptional frontend engineer with 4-6 years of experience and a passion for crafting beautiful and functional user interfaces.\n\nYou have a keen eye for design details and enjoy working alongside Designers to find new ways to delight the user.\n\nYou’re friendly, collaborative, and humble, unafraid to ask for help, ready for complex challenges, and confident in your abilities.\n\nYou emphasize personal growth and constructive feedback, believing in improving both yourself and the team.\n\nYou communicate empathetically and collaboratively with both engineering and non-engineering stakeholders, recognizing the importance of clear communication in a remote culture.\n\nYour code is clean, maintainable, and a pleasure for teammates to read.

Ideally, we’d like two of them to be managers, but we can be flexible.\n\nCompensation\n\nEach role at Help Scout has a pay range aligned to our salary formula and based on national market data. We take a competency-based approach and pay is based on the level and band of your role. We assess leveling during the hiring process for new teammates, during our bi-annual performance review cycles, and when a teammate’s role changes.\n\nOur remote compensation philosophy is not based on the employee’s geographic location.

  "description" : "Who we are\n\nAt Help Scout, we’re on a mission to help businesses delight more customers. We’ve been on this journey since 2011, and today more than 12,000 companies use our platform to provide outstanding customer support. We’ve been fully remote from the beginning, and have a team of 140+ people all over the world.\n\nWe love crafting beautiful products and growing a business together, but we're also trying to do something bigger. We're building a company that brings out your best and leaves the world a better place — a company that seeks balance between profit and purpose. That's why we've been a Certified B Corporation since 2019 and have pledged 1% of our equity back to the community.\n\nHelp Scout’s success hinges on hiring talented, high-accountability people who want to be part of creating a culture where we all feel challenged and supported to do our best work. We hope that excites you to join us!\n\nCompany values\nHappy to Help\n\nHelp is our first name. We show up for others, not because we have to, but because we want to. We share knowledge and give freely by default, and operate with generosity and empathy for each other, our customers, and our community. After all, there is no I in team (or software).\n\nCraft over Convention\n\nAlthough it’s tempting to follow a well-worn path, we push ourselves to run beyond it — even when that sets us apart from our peers. We’re building a culture where it’s safe to be ambitious and hold each other to high standards. That’s why we obsess over the last 10%, because it shows up for our customers and the business in powerful ways.\n\nProgress not Perfection\n\nThe work of building a product, culture, and brand is never done – we ship our best effort, listen, iterate, then repeat. Seeking progress requires the vulnerability to be curious, humble, and hungry to learn. Great ideas can come from anywhere, so we share our work openly, welcome the perspective of others, and continuously search for what can be improved.\n\nOwn the Outcome\n\nOwnership is key to our collective success. We consider the impact on our team and our community before we act, and believe that trust and integrity are non-negotiable. To create a better future, our decisions are made with stakeholders today and ten years from now in mind.\n\nRead more about how we define, share, and live these values here.\n\nYour Impact\n\nAs an iOS Software Engineer at Help Scout, you will work alongside our experienced Product and Design teams to build world-class mobile applications for iOS. You'll be an integral part of the mobile team that provides our customers with helpful mobile solutions that complement and enhance their interactions with Help Scout.\n\nWe aim to deliver a seamless and reliable experience on our mobile platforms, enabling agile interactions tailored to the mobile world. Our focus is on supporting our mobile users and addressing the most impactful use cases that enhance their experience.\n\nThe Team\n\nThe Engineering team sits alongside Product and Design as part of our Experience Organization at Help Scout. You will report to Alicia Rivas Perez, our Mobile Engineering Manager, and will be part of the Engineering team led by our Director of Product Engineering, Luis Morales.\n\nTime Zone Note\n\nWe believe in strong work-life blend, and since we have remote team members living between EU through PT time zones, we require that your regular working hours overlap with 8am to 12 pm ET to ensure overlap with your team members.\n\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe’re giving our entire iOS app a fresh new look and feel. You will build new features that delight our users and have the opportunity to work with Kotlin Multiplatform as we enhance the application.\n\nAs an iOS Software Engineer at Help Scout, you will:\n\nHave significant ownership in the development of our iOS application.\n\nCollaborate closely with our Android Engineers as a cohesive and collaborative Mobile Team.\n\nWork alongside Product and Design teams to provide input on the mobile application user experience and interface designs.\n\nWrite clean, efficient, and maintainable code using Swift, some Objective-C (in a few pockets of our code base), and Kotlin Multiplatform.\n\nEnsure the high performance, quality, and responsiveness of our iOS application.\n\nDebug and resolve technical issues that arise in our iOS application.\n\nWork with customers and QA testers to ensure the mobile apps continue to be a resounding success for the business.\n\nContinuously work on adding new features, optimizing for other devices, and improving the product.\n\nAbout You\n\nAs an iOS Software Engineer at Help Scout, you have a deep understanding and extensive hands-on experience with Swift.\n\nYou have a great understanding of how \"always online\" products like Help Scout communicate with web services in an unpredictable mobile reality. You can help us design everything to fail gracefully and leverage local storage to provide customers with as seamless an experience as possible.\n\nYou delight not only in how an application works but in how it looks, and you have an excellent understanding of mobile interaction design. You love working on UI animations because they can help you execute the perfect user experience.\n\nYou stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in mobile technology, specifically the iOS platform, and can provide insightful advice about leveraging native platform APIs.\n\nYou value ownership. You love to see your work in the hands of users, and you’re never afraid to dive into an issue to find the quick fix or get to the real root of the issue.\n\nYou are excited about remote work and believe that remote teams are the future of work. You can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.\n\nYou have interest in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development. Prior experience in this domain or with Kotlin is appreciated, but not required.\n\nMore information about our culture and organization\n\nEngineering Leadership Team Values\n\nExperience Org: mission, vision, strategy\n\nAbout the Process\n\nRecruiter Chat - you'll meet with Erika on the Recruiting team to get to know the company, chat through compensation, benefits, timeline, and she'll have a handful of questions about your background and experience.\n\nValue Add - you’ll meet with Alicia, Mobile Engineering Manager, to talk more about the role and your design work.\n\nTest Project - we’ll give you a take-home project that’s expected to take ~6 hours (we’ll pay for your time), then our team will review it and provide feedback.\n\nProject Discussion - we'll set up some additional time with the team to walk through your work and the decisions you made.\n\nFinal Chat - you’ll chat with another 3 people on the team, including our Eng leadership and your Product partner.\n\nReferences - we’ll ask you for three references.

  "description" : "ABOUT ZIPLINE\n\nDo you want to change the world? Zipline is on a mission to transform the way goods move. Our aim is to solve the world’s most urgent and complex access challenges by building, manufacturing, and operating the first instant delivery and logistics system that serves all humans equally, wherever they are. From powering Rwanda’s national blood delivery network and Ghana’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution, to providing on-demand home delivery for Walmart and enabling healthcare providers to bring care directly to U.S. homes, we are transforming the way things move for businesses, governments, and consumers. The technology is complex but the idea is simple: a teleportation service that delivers what you need, when you need it, with zero emissions.\n\nJoin Zipline and help us to make good on our promise to build an equitable and more resilient global supply chain for billions of people.\n\nABOUT YOU AND THE ROLE\n\nAre you eager to apply your technical skills to solve real-world problems and drive meaningful change? Do you thrive in environments where you're given ownership, creative freedom, and complex challenges to tackle? If so, join our Field Systems Engineering team at Zipline—where your work directly impacts lives every day.\n\nZipline’s long-range drone platform began operations in Rwanda in 2016. With a fixed-wing design capable of flying over 200 km on a single charge, our drones enable fast, reliable delivery of critical medical supplies to remote communities.

As a Field Systems Engineer focused on Software, you’ll play a crucial role in optimizing the performance and reliability of our long-range drone systems.\n\nIn this role, you’ll work closely with a range of cross-functional engineers and flight operators to identify friction points in how our software supports daily operations. You’ll lead anomaly investigations, define data-driven requirements, and drive execution of improvement projects to enhance system reliability, ease of maintenance, and overall usability. Whether you're implementing direct software improvements or coordinating efforts across multiple teams, your goal is to ensure the platform runs smoothly and efficiently. At times, you’ll step into a technical program management role—helping unblock other engineers, align priorities, and drive key projects forward. Success in this role requires a strong technical foundation, excellent communication skills, and the ability to translate between the needs of operators in the field and the engineers building the system.

Please note that this is a target, starting cash range for a candidate who meets the minimum qualifications for this role. The final cash pay for this role will depend on a variety of factors, including a specific candidate's experience, qualifications, skills, working location, and projected impact. The total compensation package for this role may also include: equity compensation; discretionary annual or performance bonuses; sales incentives; benefits such as medical, dental and vision insurance; paid time off; and more.\n\nZipline is an equal opportunity employer and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion or religious creed, mental or physical disability, medical condition, genetic information, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, military or veteran status, citizenship, or other characteristics protected by state, federal or local law or our other policies.\n\nWe value diversity at Zipline and welcome applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech.

  "description" : "Senior Full Stack Engineer (Go from Engineer to Future CTO)\n\nRemote | Full-time | Europe (Ukraine, Portugal welcome)\n\nPre-seed startup | Backed by ex-Meta talent\n\nWho are we?\n\nWe’re a stealth-mode startup born in Palo Alto and led by former Meta talent. We’re on a mission to redefine how AI agents interact with humans by giving them what they desperately lack: contextual memory. Think of us as the brain that powers smarter, more personal AI — and you could be building it with us.\n\nWhat do we do?\n\nWe’re developing a shared user knowledge layer — a secure and private platform where AI agents can store and recall individual user insights like dietary preferences, goals, or allergies. This allows them to respond not like bots, but like companions who actually know you.\n\nOn top of this platform, we’re building our own voice-first and text-based AI agents.\n\nWhy do we do it?\n\nToday’s AI assistants are forgetful. We want to fix that.\n\nWe believe in a future with always-on, embedded AI agents — in glasses, smart assistants, phones — that remember who you are, what you need, and how you like your coffee.\n\nBut none of this is possible without a trusted memory layer. That’s our Essence.\n\nHow do we do it?\n\nWith zero bureaucracy, high speed, and cutting-edge tools:\n\nBackend: Python (FastAPI, LLMs, Celery), Redis, Kafka, Postgres, Docker\nFrontend: TypeScript, Next.js, MUI\nInfra: AWS, Neo4j (bonus!)\nCulture: Fast, lean, product-obsessed. No middle managers, no bloated processes. Just building.\nWho works for us?\n\nTwo founders and a fire in the belly. One ex-Meta engineer, one operator with startup grit. You’ll be our first engineering hire, joining at ground zero with massive influence on product, culture, and codebase.\n\nWe’re not just offering a job — we’re offering a seat at the table.\n\nWhy is there a vacancy?\n\nOur MVP is taking shape, and interest from investors and early users is heating up. It’s time to bring in a builder who can co-lead the tech and take it to the next level.\n\nWho are we looking for?\n\nYou’re a senior full stack developer with a hacker mindset, product sense, and leadership potential. Someone who:\n\nHas 6+ years of hands-on product engineering experience\nCan own both backend and frontend with confidence\nThrives in chaos, ambiguity, and fast pivots\nCraves building something that doesn’t exist yet\nWants to shape what we build — not just how\nWhat professional skills are important to us?\nExpert in Python, especially with FastAPI, LLM integration, Redis, Kafka, Postgres\nStrong in TypeScript, Next.js, MUI\nExperience with Docker, AWS, and production-grade infrastructure\nBonus points for Neo4j or other graph DBs\nYou move fast, make smart trade-offs, and bring product intuition to the table\nWhat will you do?\nArchitect and code our platform front-to-back\nBuild and train our in-house AI agents\nDeploy secure, scalable infrastructure on AWS\nCollaborate directly with founders on product vision and roadmap\nBe the spark behind our early engineering culture — and possibly grow into our CTO\nWhat do we offer?\n100% remote work setup\nHigh-impact role from Day 0\nReal ownership, autonomy, and voice in product direction\nFlexible hours — we care about output, not timesheets\nPath to CTO as we scale\nWhat’s our hiring process?\nIntro call – Meet Recrucial, our hiring partner\nFounder chat – Talk vision and vibe with the team\nTech deep dive – Show us how you build and think\nCulture & offer – Let’s make it official\n\nReady to build AI’s missing memory layer — and maybe become our future CTO?\n\nApply now. Let’s shape the future together.",

Mainstay is looking for a Chief Revenue Officer who has built and scaled growth teams, thrives on collaboration, and brings a steady mix of strategic thinking and operational discipline.\n\nWho We Are\n\nAt Mainstay we deeply care about the outcomes of our partners. We're an extension of their teams who work to understand their goals, strategic priorities and plans, and align our efforts to meet their needs as a true partner. We use technology to scale the science of student success coaching through a communications platform that coaches students to and through college. We are a Public Benefit Corporation, with a commitment to helping more students access and achieve higher learning. We use human-centered, AI-enhanced coaching to proactively help learners find the answers they need, wherever they are, whenever they need it--and offer colleges a way to scale one-on-one support to their entire student body.\n\nAs Chief Revenue Officer, you’ll lead our go-to-market teams — including sales, marketing, and customer success. Reporting to the CEO and working closely with the VP of Finance and CPO, you’ll help shape and implement the strategies that drive sustainable revenue growth and expand our reach across education and workforce ecosystems.\n\nYou’ve led revenue and go-to-market teams in a B2B SaaS business — maybe in higher ed, maybe not — but you know how to build a system that works. You’re not looking for a rinse-and-repeat job. You want a challenge.

You’re comfortable working across departments, rolling up your sleeves when needed, and helping a team do the best work of their careers.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nSet and Execute Go-to-Market Strategy\nBuild a clear, focused GTM plan that connects what we do to what our customers need\nGet sales, marketing, and customer success moving in sync\nWork closely with product, engineering, and finance to turn company goals into action\nBuild and Strengthen the Team\nLead a cross-functional team — develop the leaders, support the doers\nPut systems in place so the team can operate with consistency and confidence\nCreate a culture where people know what’s expected, get better every day, and take pride in their work\nDrive Sustainable Growth\nUse data to see what’s working, fix what’s not, and stay ahead of the curve\nFind new product opportunities and keep the GTM engine running smoothly\nMake sure teams are aligned so the partner experience feels seamless\nRepresent Mainstay in the Market\nBuild strong relationships with institutional leaders and decision-makers\nShow up with clarity, insight, and a real understanding of how we help students and schools succeed\n\nWhat You’ll Have\n\n15+ years of experience leading go-to-market or revenue functions at a B2B SaaS company, driving sustainable growth over time\nBuilt and scaled teams across sales, marketing, and customer success — and worked closely with product, finance, and support\nDesigned full-funnel strategies that connect lead gen to retention, with metrics and accountability at every step\nBalanced strategy with execution — knowing when to step back, and when to dive into the details\nUsed data to make decisions, coach teams, and constantly improve performance\nCreated a culture that rewards ownership, follow-through, and improvement over perfection\nExperience leading teams through ambiguity, innovation cycles, and rapid change\nA collaborative mindset — you work well with visionary founders, cross-functional teams, and external partners leading with with clarity, humility, and strong communication and a belief that alignment is more powerful than control\nYou take the work seriously, not yourself\n\nThis role reports directly to the CEO. Remote candidates within the U.S. are welcome. Occasional travel to Boston and partner sites is expected.\n\nMainstay is committed to creating a company where all employees regardless of background can show up and feel they belong. This is an ongoing journey, and we welcome questions on where we’re at during your interview process. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Actual compensation packages are based on a wide array of factors unique to each candidate including but not limited to demonstrated skill set, years & depth of experience, and some role dependent factors that can include certifications and software expertise. We also hope you’ll consider and be open to what else we provide outside of our base compensation.

  "description" : "Bubble is an AI visual development platform that enables anyone from first-time entrepreneurs to enterprise-level companies to take an idea from prompt to fully functional, scalable reality — all without writing or managing a single line of code.\n\nRather than specializing in one or two aspects of web development, Bubble’s full-stack visual programming interface does it all, allowing you to customize your UX with a drag-and-drop editor, build out logic, manage databases, and integrate with anything via plugins and API. As the only full-stack, no-code platform on the market with over 5 million users in over 100 countries, Bubble is breaking down the barriers to entrepreneurship and innovation across the globe.\n\nWhat we’ve achieved:\n\nOur product is working, and we are thriving. Entire VC-backed companies have been built entirely on Bubble. After finding product market fit and 8 years of bootstrapping, we raised a $100 million Series A and we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in the New York tech ecosystem.\n\nYou can build just about anything on Bubble - and our community is living proof. More than just launching products, people are turning their ideas into real businesses. Mailead grew a $10k investment in a Bubble product into a $2M valuation, while Faceless.video went from 0 to $1M+ ARR in less than a year, among many other examples.\n\nAbout the team:\n\nBubble focuses on building web applications, and our top request from users is to support native iOS and Android apps. We have a small team working on this, and the mobile product is currently in private beta. We're seeking a Staff Engineer to drive technical development from beta to a fully developed product. This involves expanding our web editor to include mobile app creation, setting up infrastructure for deploying apps to the iOS and Google Play stores, and developing a React Native runtime that works with Bubble’s backend. This is a key initiative for 2025, opening up a new market that will significantly impact our business.\n\nIn This Role You’ll:\n\nDrive design and implementation of our Mobile application builder.\n\nArchitect deployment pipelines for seamless publishing to the Apple App Store and Google Play, integrating with Bubble’s existing infrastructure.\n\nCollaborate cross-functionally with product, design, and support teams to ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience across web and mobile.\n\nMentor and coach engineers to improve their technical skills and leadership.\n\nPartner directly with executive leadership to define roadmaps, inform and commit to priorities, and execute effectively.\n\nAbout You:\n\n8+ years of industry experience as a software engineer, preferably at high-growth startups\n\nExposure to building with React Native (expertise preferred, but not required!)\n\nExperience leading projects and designing technical solutions\n\nStrong coding skills and the ability to mentor other engineers\n\nExcellent communication skills\n\nAlignment with our values: a desire to empower others, a focus on team and user success over individual achievement, and transparency and willingness to admit mistakes and failures\n\n\nOur Tech Stack:\n\nFrontend: Typescript, SolidJS, React Native\n\nBackend: Typescript, Node.js\n\nAI/ML: Python, LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), LangChain\n\nInfrastructure: AWS, CDK / Terraform, ECS, Redis, Postgres\n\nData & AI Workflows: JSON-based app representations, proprietary datasets\n\nCompensation:\n\nWe offer competitive compensation aligned to tier one markets. Our estimated salary for this role at Bubble ranges from $164,000 to $246,000. Actual pay is determined by multiple factors such as skills, qualifications, experience and market demand.\n\nLocation:\n\nFor this role, Bubble is currently only considering candidates who are authorized to work in the US and are within the New York City metro area.\n\nWe prefer hiring people within commuting distance of our NYC office because we value getting together in person regularly. For those who enjoy working from our Manhattan office on a more regular basis, we offer catered lunches, and happy hours, among other fun perks.\n\nBenefits:\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, Bubble offers a robust benefits package equating to roughly twenty thousand in additional annual compensation:\n\nOur benefits include, but are not limited to:\n\nComprehensive health coverage\n\n401(k) matching\n\nWellness and work enablement stipends\n\nFlexible PTO\n\nA Sabbatical program\n\nJoin us!\n\nLet’s democratize access to technology together! If this sounds like you, apply! If you don’t meet all of the qualifications but think you could be a match, we’d still love the chance to review your application. At Bubble, we encourage people from all ages, abilities, and experiences to apply.

Operating in remote, often communications-limited environments, our vehicles rely on a robust autonomy stack and smart sensor integration to carry out persistent missions with minimal human intervention.\n\nIf you're excited by rapid prototyping, hands-on testing, and writing software that directly drives real-world robotic systems, this is a chance to make a big impact in a fast-evolving field.\n\nAbout You:\n\nYou like working in small teams and iterating quickly. You keep up on recent developments in software and robotics, and you’ve been known to write code for recreational projects outside of work. You can probably type really fast, or can think so clearly that you don’t need to type fast, or both. Additionally, you have:\n\n5+ years of experience in the software industry, and 3+ years developing embedded software, ideally for real-time or resource-constrained systems.\nProficiency in Python and solid skills in C and/or C++.\nWorked extensively on software for an embedded Linux target.\nHandled integration for a variety of sensor data (IMU, GPS, RADAR, LiDAR).\nHands-on experience with microcontroller hardware and low-level firmware development.\nExperience with multi-threaded application development.\nThe ability to conceptualize and implement software architectures that are both reliable and scalable.\nExcellent collaboration and teamwork skills, with a side of humility.\nA love for moving fast, but dissatisfaction with things that aren’t robust.\n\nBonus points if you have:\n\nA background in mobile robotics — especially familiarity with:\nPID control systems\nObject avoidance\nPath planning\nOnboard resource management\nFamiliarity with ROS (or other robotics platform).\nExperience working on and maintaining large or mature software systems.\nExperience writing software for a machine capable of destroying itself.\n\nRole Details:\n\nIn this role, you’ll work across the stack, from writing low-level drivers to implementing higher-level decision-making logic. On a day-to-day / week-to-week basis, you will:\n\nDesign, implement, and test new features to make our boats smarter, more robust, and easier to use.\nDevelop and validate new autonomy algorithms to safely guide our boats through channels and across oceans.\nWork hands-on to integrate new sensors and payloads (sometimes at a moment’s notice!).\nContinuously add to and improve our automated test suite, tooling, and health checks.\nSupport vehicle checkout, testing, troubleshooting, and demonstrations by making trips to our local launch points with a laptop (and potentially to customer sites, if you’re interested in travel) to provide hands-on support.\n\nThis is an excellent opportunity to do high impact work, see your code go into live field robotics applications, and join a fun and hard working team on the cutting edge of ocean autonomy. Whether you’re a new grad or a 30 year industry vet, we expect an open-minded learning attitude from everyone at Seasats.\n\nLife at Seasats:\n\nAlong with your salary, you’ll receive perks including:\n\nStock options\nCompetitive insurance (including a 99% employer-covered Gold HMO plan or other options)\n401k matching up to 4% of salary\nFour free lunches per week\nAn employee activity fund\nA pet-friendly office\nUnlimited/Flex PTO\n\nWe’ll help you ramp up and will regularly take time to discuss what’s working and what’s not. We’re also big on personal freedoms: if you’re on top of your responsibilities and want the afternoon off to surf or spend time with friends and family, go for it! We have flexible hours, accommodating PTO, and a personable, high-achieving work culture. We want someone who’s excited to work hard and have fun in this environment.\n\nOur values are listed below; we’re happy to explain them more during the interview process.\n\nGet Stuff Done\nBe Kind\nFight Entropy\nAttack with Overwhelming Force\nAsk More Questions\nLines, Not Dots\n\nHiring Notes:\n\nIf you decide to apply, you’ll be asked to provide a resume and answer a few screening questions. If we decide to move forward with your application, you can expect no more than 2-3 more rounds of virtual interviews before a final in-person interview. If you have to travel to San Diego, we’ll reimburse pre-approved travel costs.\n\nPlease note that we are currently unable to sponsor employment visas, so candidates must be independently authorized to work in the United States.\n\nWe appreciate diverse perspectives and life experiences, so we encourage women, minorities, and people of all backgrounds to apply. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\n\nWe look forward to reviewing your application!",

Through our proprietary technology platform, we offer Credit and SaaS solutions that enable our customers to drive their business forward. In doing so, Novicap actively supports thousands of businesses to help them deliver impact for their stakeholders.\n\nWith offices in Barcelona and Madrid we are one of the fastest growing fintech startups in Europe. Amazing, isn’t it?\n\nWe are currently looking for Software Engineers who want to join our team. You will help us in building and maintaining our core platform, from ideation to deployment and beyond ????. This is a place where everybody has a voice and we love to hear it, so you will be able to share your ideas and opinions from day one.\n\nSounds interesting? Keep reading! ​\nYour mission\nAs said, you will join us as a Software Engineer to help us with our platform. We are growing at a fast pace and we also want to build new features and new products.\n\nYou will have the opportunity to be involved in a lot of things. In your first month you will land in the company and the team, getting to know the people and the way we work. Onboarding is important for us, so we will make sure you have everything you need to start rocking it!\nIn three months you will be part of the Tech team that has developed this from the very beginning. The development will go smoothly, all the gears will be working, and you will be helping to improve the parts that still need to be fine-tuned.\n\nIn six months you will be a key part of the team; an autonomous contributor who knows how to teamplay. Your feedback will have helped to change the quality of what we build.\nHow will you do it?\n\nAt the moment Novicap is powered by a Ruby on Rails platform and a few services written in Python and Javascript hosted in AWS. The services talk to each other using REST, data is stored in PostgreSQL, and the frontend uses React.\n\nWe are a data-intensive business, so there are a lot of integrations with third-party services and financial institutions. We have a relentless drive for clean, secure and well-tested code, which shows during code reviews, and whenever a change is approved it gets deployed automatically through our zero-downtime CI/CD pipeline.\n\nThe team is distributed across Barcelona, Madrid and elsewhere in Spain. We expect you to spend some time in our Barcelona office with the team and the rest of Novicapers (we can tell you you’ll have fun!).\n\nWho will you work with?\n\nYou will report directly to the Engineering Manager. He expects you to add value so be prepared to give all the feedback needed! There are other 4 software engineers in the team already waiting for you to join with arms wide open.\n\nYou are who we are looking for if you:\n\nHere comes the interesting part: if you have read this far but Ruby on Rails is not the language you are pro at, do not worry! We can also consider Python, Java, .NET, PHP… as we think it gives our tech team plasticity in solving problems. You’ll need to have senior experience in any kind of tech stack.\n\nYou will also have production experience and the ability to get things done, actively considering the fine balance between shipping speed and perfection. This is possible by having an impact-driven mentality; you understand how your work impacts customers and coworkers.\n\nYou will put in place your problem solving skills, since our work often requires implementing unconventional solutions and, sometimes, you should be able to find non-engineering ways around the problem.\n\nLast, but not least, being able to communicate in English is super important for us. We are a multicultural team and want everybody to feel comfortable and involved, so you should have a good level and be capable of giving feedback and gathering information from other departments and peers.\n\nWhat we offer?\n\nYou don’t live in Spain? No worries, we take care of your visa process to be able to work here.\n\nA full-time, hybrid position in which you would choose, with your team, when do you need to go to the office.\n\nYou’ll join us for our annual company-wide events and be able to meet the rest of the team that’s distributed in Spain.\n\nTake the opportunity to become one of the core developers of a fast-growing, profitable fintech company which has found product-market fit.\n\nFlexible benefits with: you will be able to include in your paycheck the monthly expenses for food, transportation, daycare and others\n\nMedical insurance: we offer an optional health insurance through Sanitas, with competitive rates and Novicap subsidizes 30% to guarantee your wellbeing\n\nCommunicate better with your colleagues by signing up for free English or Spanish classes if you need them\n\nGym membership with Urban Sports Club, partly subsidized by Novicap (we also have a running club!)\n\nIncredible and highly motivated co-workers\n\nYou will participate in our company events and get to meet the rest of the team that is spread across Spain\n\nYou will be part of our dynamic and international work environment, with a flat hierarchy and open communication between teams\n\nLibrary with plenty of books to choose from. If you can't find anything, let us know and we'll add it to the library.\n\nFree fruit, coffee and tea in the office. We know it's customary, but we like to take care of you anyway.\n\nNovicap is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, religion, physical or mental disability, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, or any other basis protected by law, ordinance, or regulation. We make every effort to ensure that all candidates are treated fairly and equally.\n\nIf you think you don't tick all the boxes, we'd still love to hear from you. Nobody checks every box, and we are looking for someone excited to join the team!\n\nSolicitar este puesto de trabajo\nAbout us\n\nNovicap is an end-to-end working capital solutions provider focused on enabling CFOs/Finance teams of SMEs to pay their suppliers and collect from their customers.
